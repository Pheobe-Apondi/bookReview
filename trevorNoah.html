                        <p>When Trevor Noah was born in 1984, South Africa was still ruled by the laws of Apartheid. Apartheid was the South African government’s way 
                            of institutionalizing racism by segregating blacks and whites. The segregation was meant to impose feelings of difference between the races, 
                            including prohibiting interracial sexual  relations. 
                              Being born to a black mother and a white Swiss-German father violated these laws; consequently,
                               Trevor Noah's existence was considered a crime.  Due to the law, he had to be separated from his white father.
                        </div>
                    </div>
                        <div>
                             
                            This also put him in trouble, as he was not fully accepted by whites and did not fully belong to blacks. He felt “too white to be black, and
                             too black to be white.” He had to be hidden from the authorities. Even though the government categorized Trevor Noah as “colored,” he didn’t 
                             fully identify with that group either, leading to a feeling of belonging nowhere.
                             <br>
                            Trevor’s experience of racial liminality reflects identity struggles in different areas of multiculturalism. For example, in Ethiopia, there was
                             a war that started in 2022 and continued for three years. At that time, citizens began to differentiate each other based on race, region, and 
                              the language they spoke. There was no freedom to move from one region to another because of race, and people were arrested for traveling to other regions.
                              <br><br>
                            Trevor Noah also describes in his book that he felt like an outsider while attending Sandringham School, which consisted of Indian, black, white, and Chinese
                             students. The kids were grouped by color. Trevor Noah recounted that he was not welcomed by the colored students, as he was black. He could not be a Chinese 
                             or Indian kid. Most of his time was spent with black kids, but he could not be part of that group because they rode and walked home without him, leading to his
                              exclusion. At the end of the day, he was all by himself.
                              <br><br>
                            Like Trevor Noah, I felt like a stranger when I changed schools during COVID-19. Students, teachers, and administration were all new to me. I knew nobody, so I 
                            had to handle 
                            everything by myself.
                            Finally, Trevor finds a way to cope with the complexities of his mixed race. He learned multiple languages to adapt to different cultures, creating the perception 
                            that
                             he belonged to various groups. He stated that language could be a powerful tool for understanding and acceptance.</p>

                        <p>"The genius of arpatheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate,is what it was. 
                            You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all."
                                 <br><br>
                            Trevor's birth is considered a crime under South Africa's Immorality Act, because he is born from a Swiss white father and a black Xhosa mum.
                             This was during a time when such relations were considered illegal. He was therefore classified as colored. This meant he couldn't walk openly with his father 
                             and at times with his mother.
                              In the book we see how at times when his mum would take him to the park she had to pretend to be his nanny. His existence demanded secrecy. 
                            From birth his life had already been shaped by arpatheid.

                    Though arpatheid officially ended in 1994, the systemic effects it left were very impactful even after. Trevor's constant shifting between neighborhoods shows how arpatheid created lasting inequalities that defined people's 
                    opportunities and limitations.Arpatheid taught people how to fear each other, live with shame and view themselves as inferior. This is a very systemic issue that can be seen in most african countries that were colonised. In Kenya, whites are often given priority in establishments such as high restaurants and clubs, one could argue that they bring in the money and this is just business, but this believe that because they are white they must have money,
                    is built upon black people's inferirority complex.
                    <br><br>
                
                    Arpatheid had adverse effects but we should not forget that it bore movements.
                     People who rebelled against that systemic oppression. Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, 
                     Trevoh's mother bears that legacy, She fiercly rebelled against arpatheid in her actions. 
                     Through her we see the legacy wasn't just one of oppression but of resistance.
                     <br>
                     Born a Crime shows that the true legacy of apatheird lives in the people, in how they speak,where they live and how free they can dream. It reminds us that the effects of injustice don't end when the laws change.

                            "Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being."
                            Trevor's existence is illegal. He is "born a crime" because apartheid laws have banned a relationship between different races. Despite being judged and isolated, she raises Trevor alone with love, treating him not as a crime but as a blessing.
                            Patricia's love is unconditional and sacrificial. Her bond with Trevor is unbreakable. They were not just a family, they were also teammates, which gives him a strong foundation of confidence.
                            In communities affected by war or displacement, like in parts of Africa, many mothers have had to raise their children alone due to the absence of fathers, just like Patricia did.
                            Their sacrifice and courage mirror the powerful theme in Born a Crime, that family love and commitment can overcome even the hardest conditions.

                        <h4>Protection</h4>
                        "My mother said, ' If you don't fight for yourself, no one will fight for you.'"
                        Patricia goes to extreme length to protect Trevor physically and emotionally.
                        Patricia hides him indoors so the police don't see he's mixed-race. She moves from place to place, changing jobs and churches, always thinking how best to shield him from a world that could punish him just for existing. Even her strict parenting like punishing him when he misbehaves or demanding he read and speak in multiple languages is a form of protection.
                        Immigrant parents sometimes give up legal names or falsify documents to get their children into better schools or safer living environments. Like Patricia, their goal is not for gain, but protection from harm.
                        <h4>Survival</h4>
                        "In South Africa, you were breaking the law just by being born. We had to be criminals to live."
                        Survival was a daily mission for Trevor and his mother. From navigating apartheid's racist laws to escaping domestic abuse, they live by resilience. Trevor learns to code-switch between languages and social groups to avoid conflict and gain acceptance.
                        Their survival isn't just physical. It was psychological and cultural. Trevor becomes a master of identity, always analyzing, learning how to stay invisible when needed, and how to speak up when safe.
                        Street children in big cities often survive by hustling, selling items, and performing tricks.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>"We tell people to follow their dreams, no matter what. I say chase your dreams, but be realistic. Understand that sometimes your dream isn't going to happen.
                             You have to be willing to let it go. But I think if you aim for the stars, you'll land on the moon."
                            This seemingly simple piece of advice, tucked within the pages of "Born a Crime," hints at a profound 
                            truth that manifests in his extraordinary life story.
                             
                    Trevor's ability to find humor in the face of absurdity,
                    danger, and apartheid wasn't just a coping mechanism, it was a vital form of armor.
                   Growing up mixed-race of the apartheid in South Africa, a world designed to categorize and oppress, Noah navigated the 
                   betrayous social landscapes with wisdom, writing his life story. Trevor's ability to find humor in the face of absurdity, danger,
                    and injustice wasn't just a coping mechanism, it was a vital form of armor.only for a moment.

                    His narrative isn't just a recounting of hardship; 
                    it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, fueled by the unexpected power of laughter.
                   The Absurdity of Identity: Finding the Joke in Being "Colored"
                   One of the most striking ways Noah wielded his humor as armor was in navigating his ambiguous racial identity.
                    Classified as "colored" under apartheid, he belonged to a category that was neither Black nor White, existing in a 
                    limited space full of contradictions. He recalls several instances where this in-betweenness, while often confusing and sometimes
                     dangerous, also presented opportunities for comedic observation. For example, his description of his mother's stubbornness and often
                      hilarious attempts to evade the authorities is portrayed with humor. He found humor in the ridiculousness of a system that tried so desperately
                       to categorize people by boxing them illogically.
                   "Chinese people were classified as black and treated as second-citizens, while Japanese people were classified as white so the South African government
                    could enjoy all the privileges given by the Japanese government at the time. It wasn't about color or biology- it was about power and money"
                   Here, Trevor jokes about how crazy it was that two groups of East Asians could be treated differently because of poilitics. 
                   <br><br>
                   Politics is for sure a dirty game!
                   Language as a Weapon and a Shield: The Power of a Well-Timed Joke
                   Noah's linguistic agility was not just a skill but a crucial tool for survival, often deployed with comedy. His ability to speak multiple languages like Xhosa,
                    his mother-tongue language, Zulu and Tswana allowed him to connect with different groups and avoid potentially hostile situations that came his way. Consider the 
                    anecdote where he narrowly escapes a beating by speaking Zulu to a group of intimidating men. The shock and subsequent laughter his linguistic prowess elicited
                     transformed a potentially dangerous encounter into a moment of shared humanity and connection with the Zulu strangers. In this instance, humor, delivered through
                      language, acted as a shield, deflecting aggression and building bridges where there were none.
                   "I became a chameleon. My color didn't change, but i could change your perception about my color. I could walk through any group and say, 'What's Up my friend?' in
                    Zulu, and they'd be like, "This little colored kid is cool. He's one of us' I could speak to Indian kids in Gujarati, to white kids in English, to colored kids in Afrikaans. I learned the quickest way to bridge the gap between people is through language."

                        <p>"When it was time to pick my name, she chose Trevor, a name with no meaning whatsoever
                            In South Africa, no precedent in my family. It's not even a biblical name. It's just a name. My mother wanted her child to be beholden to no fate.
                             She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, and be anyone."
                                     
                           Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah is a fearless, devout, and nonetheless independent woman who single-handedly mothered 
                          Trevor Noah ever since he was a small kid.             
                              Patricia was devoted to showing Trevor that every opportunity is accessible to anyone, especially someone from their class and race.
                              
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> She managed to protect Trevor by hiding him inside and, at times, pretending that she was his maid to avoid being seen together in public, mainly because she loved him and could not afford to lose him to the law. Patricia dedicated herself to teaching Trevor English as his first language and exposing him to so much information involving his role as a man and relationships. This would mould Trevor’s confidence and push him to become the famous personality he is today.
                        
                        Patricia was also very keen on Trevor’s discipline, offering beatings whenever necessary. This was to imply that the society is ruthless to a man of colour,
                         and unless he stands up for himself, he will live to be suppressed for the rest of his days. She was, however, very protective of Trevor whenever he was in trouble. She defended him in school when he got into trouble and never held back from defending Trevor against Abel.
                      
                                     
                                    
                       Patricia, as implied in the book, was Trevor’s greatest inspiration. It is quite clear that Patricia was Trevor’s greatest hero, and without her, he would not have pushed through his life as a man of colour.</p>
