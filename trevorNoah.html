                        <p>When Trevor Noah was born in 1984, South Africa was still ruled by the laws of Apartheid. Apartheid was the South African government’s way of institutionalizing racism by segregating blacks and whites. For Trevenor, being born to a black mother and a white Swiss-German father violated these laws; consequently, his existence was considered a crime. Even though the government categorized Trevor Noah as “colored,” he didn’t fully identify with that group either, leading to a feeling of belonging nowhere.
                            However, Trevenor didn't give him time to feel inferior. Instead, he found a way to deal with racialism. He learned multiple languages to adapt to different cultures, creating the perception that he belonged to various groups. He stated that language could be a powerful tool for understanding and acceptance.</p>

                        <p>"The genius of arpatheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate,is what it was. 
                            You separate people into groups and make them hate one another so you can run them all."
                                 <br><br>
                            Trevor's birth is considered a crime under South Africa's Immorality Act, because he is born from a Swiss white father and a black Xhosa mum.
                             This was during a time when such relations were considered illegal. He was therefore classified as colored. This meant he couldn't walk openly with his father 
                             and at times with his mother.
                              In the book we see how at times when his mum would take him to the park she had to pretend to be his nanny. His existence demanded secrecy. 
                            From birth his life had already been shaped by arpatheid.
                             <br><br>
                            Though arpatheid officially ended in 1994, the systemic effects it left were very impactful even after. Trevor's constant shifting between neighborhoods shows how arpatheid created lasting inequalities that defined people's 
                            opportunities and limitations.Arpatheid taught people how to fear each other, live with shame and view themselves as inferior. This is a very systemic issue that can be seen in most african countries that were colonised. In Kenya, whites are often given priority in establishments such as high restaurants and clubs, one could argue that they bring in the money and this is just business, but this believe that because they are white they must have money,
                            is built upon black people's inferirority complex.
                            <br><br>
                        
                            Arpatheid had adverse effects but we should not forget that it bore movements.
                             People who rebelled against that systemic oppression. Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, 
                             Trevoh's mother bears that legacy, She fiercly rebelled against arpatheid in her actions. 
                             Through her we see the legacy wasn't just one of oppression but of resistance.
                             <br>
                             Born a Crime shows that the true legacy of apatheird lives in the people, in how they speak,where they live and how free they can dream. It reminds us that the effects of injustice don't end when the laws change.

                <h2>Humor as Armour</h2>
                <h4>Author:Jennifer Chinyere</h4>

                        <p>"We tell people to follow their dreams, no matter what. I say chase your dreams, but be realistic. Understand that sometimes your dream isn't going to happen. You have to be willing to let it go. But I think if you aim for the stars, you'll land on the moon."
                            This seemingly simple piece of advice, tucked within the pages of "Born a Crime," hints at a profound truth that manifests in his extraordinary life story. Trevor's ability to find humor in the face of absurdity, danger, and apartheid wasn't just a coping mechanism, it was a vital form of armor.
                            Growing up mixed-race of the apartheid in South Africa, a world designed to categorize and oppress, Noah navigated the betrayous social landscapes with wisdom, writing his life story. Trevor's ability to find humor in the face of absurdity, danger, and injustice wasn't just a coping mechanism, it was a vital form of armor.only for a moment. His narrative isn't just a recounting of hardship; it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, fueled by the unexpected power of laughter.
                            The Absurdity of Identity: Finding the Joke in Being "Colored"
                            One of the most striking ways Noah wielded his humor as armor was in navigating his ambiguous racial identity. Classified as "colored" under apartheid, he belonged to a category that was neither Black nor White, existing in a limited space full of contradictions. He recalls several instances where this in-betweenness, while often confusing and sometimes dangerous, also presented opportunities for comedic observation. For example, his description of his mother's stubbornness and often hilarious attempts to evade the authorities is portrayed with humor. He found humor in the ridiculousness of a system that tried so desperately to categorize people by boxing them illogically.
                            "Chinese people were classified as black and treated as second-citizens, while Japanese people were classified as white so the South African government could enjoy all the privileges given by the Japanese government at the time. It wasn't about color or biology- it was about power and money"
                            Here, Trevor jokes about how crazy it was that two groups of East Asians could be treated differently because of poilitics. Politics is for sure a dirty game!Language as a Weapon and a Shield: The Power of a Well-Timed Joke
                            Noah's linguistic agility was not just a skill but a crucial tool for survival, often deployed with comedy. His ability to speak multiple languages like Xhosa, his mother-tongue language, Zulu and Tswana allowed him to connect with different groups and avoid potentially hostile situations that came his way. Consider the anecdote where he narrowly escapes a beating by speaking Zulu to a group of intimidating men. The shock and subsequent laughter his linguistic prowess elicited transformed a potentially dangerous encounter into a moment of shared humanity and connection with the Zulu strangers. In this instance, humor, delivered through language, acted as a shield, deflecting aggression and building bridges where there were none.
                            "I became a chameleon. My color didn't change, but i could change your perception about my color. I could walk through any group and say, 'What's Up my friend?' in Zulu, and they'd be like, "This little colored kid is cool. He's one of us' I could speak to Indian kids in Gujarati, to white kids in English, to colored kids in Afrikaans. I learned the quickest way to bridge the gap between people is through language."
                            Childhood Mischief as a Form of Rebellion: Being Light-hearted in Restrictions
                            </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="family">

                </div>

                <p>Even in his childhood exploit, Trevor portrays humor against the restrictive environment he grew up in. His mischievous adventures with his friend Teddy, often partnering in absurd things like stealing from a mall a couple of times and ending up being chased for miles by the police, highlights a youthful spirit that refused to be fully constrained by the oppressive realities around them. Think about the story of him accidentally setting the white neighborhood on fire with his childhood friends. While the consequences were serious, the recalling of the event is filled with a youthful kind of humor that underscores the absurdity i see in the situation. This humor doesn't diminish the gravity of the incident but rather offers a lens through which we can view the innate inequalities and the small acts of unintentional rebellion especially in someone's childhood.
                    "We tell ourselves we feel bad about it but it is not true. We feel bad because we got caught. We feel bad because it might hurt our reputation.We dont actually feel bad about the thing we did. Regret is just a waste of time. Failure has answer but regret never does. We can only learn from it and move on.
                    The Humor of Observation: Finding a Funny in Everyday Life
                    Beyond the dangerous situations Noah faces, his humor still manages to shine through in his daily observations in South Africa particularly Soweto, his neighborhood. He finds things that are funny in cultural differences, family dynamics (particularly his relationship with his strict mother). He tells stories about his mother's strict upbringing especially when insisting on regular church attendance that he wasn't comfortable with. Patricia's (Trevor's mom) unconventional methods of raising him are filled with warmth and humor.
                    I must say I am so inspired by this in particular, "finding the funny in our daily life". For the most time ever I have been wondering if it was wrong of me or just "too much" to be laughing at one funny situation or another. Sometimes I'll just be by my business with a serious face then before you know, I giggle by myself! I know it sounds weird to some of us a short brief explanation of but trust me it's okay to laugh at funny thoughts that just crossed your mind. Laughing should not be limited to the current moment but should be shared by our old selves too. It helps us embrace the warmth of our past by bringing it back to life or even learning from the dark moments that did'nt go well then work on them without having to put a lot of pressure on ourselves.
                    My one wish for the world is that we 'live more' and 'laugh more.'In conclusion
                    Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" is more than just a memoir; it's a great novel in using humor not as an escape from reality, but as a way to navigate and even challenge it. His laughter, born from the pain of his early life, became his armor, allowing him to connect with others, decrease tension, and ultimately, to tell his remarkable story with an evoking voice that is both sad and funny. His journey reminds us that even in the darkest of times, the ability to laugh can be a powerful testament to the enduring strength of our human spirit.
                    It is so unfortunate that 85% of suicidal cases are contributed by mental stressors. However a lot of awareness has been raised by therapy organisations and teams on mental awareness. Explore more on "Why Humor Belongs in the Therapy Room"
